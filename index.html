	I started out majoring in Computer Science, but have since switched to the more business oriented "Information Systems" program.  I left the school a senior, focusing more on my career and family.  I do intend to return at some point in the future.

        <span class="timeframe">08/11 - Present as <strong>Web Developer</strong></span>
        <p>
	At Metal Toad Media I developed code for various clients.  The projects I work on here were mostly Drupal sites.  Here's a small sampling of some of the Drupal sites I worked on: <a href="http://www.fearnet.com/">FEARnet</a>, <a href="http://www.infocus.com" >InFocus</a>, <a href="http://www.pvld.org/">PVLD</a>, <a href="http://www.greenbiz.com">Greenbiz</a>, <a href="http://www.hercampus.com/">HerCampus</a>, <a href="http://www.peci.org/">PECI</a>.  In addition to my Drupal work, I collaborated on a large HTML 5 JavaScript application, <a href="http://www.mgo.com">mGo</a>, targeted for mobile devices as well as television set top boxes and smart TVs.  I also had fun writing a small HTML 5 canvas game for Android devices via phonegap.  I was introduced to python and Django here and have worked on custom Django apps and contributed code to <a href="http://notredam.org">NotreDAM</a>.  I also aided in Puppet configuration and adding new puppet agents.

        <p>
        As a developer at Ibex Data Systems, we focused on a few large clients' sites.  Each site had a similar, custom-built codebase that I helped to maintain and develop.  All work was done in PHP and I had fun learning the proper way to author jQuery plugins here.

	    <span class="timeframe">06/09 - 11/10 as <strong>Web Developer</strong></span>
	    <p>
	    <!--I primarily provided custom code (in mostly PHP and Ruby) to Development Now's clients.  -->The work at development now is specialized to mobilizing websites and building social media sites.  The social network engines I worked with were Dolphin, Social Engine, Buddypress, as well as custom-coded solutions.  All work was done in PHP and Ruby.  <!--In addition to providing code, -->I also performed minor systems administration requests for a few clients.<!--  These requests typically included rolling out new code, configuring their environment (typically LAMP based), and troubleshooting any errors.-->

	    <p>
	    I worked with a team of web developers to maintain and expand filefront.com.  I was involved with updating legacy code, implementing a memcached setup, implementing new features, developing many test cases for our infrastructure.  I also had to provide QA for other team members' code and then roll their changes out to the live site once it passed my requirements.  I was involved in maintaining the infrastructure as well (bringing up downed servers, restoring crashed databases, helping to roll out significant hardware upgrades, etc.).
	    </p>
            <p>
            As director of technology I oversaw a team of web developers and a system administrator.  I ensured the security and overall stability of the FileFront network.  I helped to upgrade many of the services running on our network to provide a higher level of security.<!-- - in addition to auditing the network internally and externally.-->  I managed about 200 servers running a variety of services (primarily on linux or freebsd) - http, ftp, mysql, video encoding, and more.  <!--As part of managing these servers, -->I worked heavily with the systems administrator to set up new systems from installing the OS to service configuration.

	    I'm the co-founder of AntiClothes, an online T-shirt store specializing in humor shirts.  I implemented the website in magento commerce, which was heavily modified to better suit our needs.  I handled all day to day operations: shipping, customer relation, inventory, supply, server management &amp; optimization, and site development.  I used a LAMP environment with memcached, svn, and apc.

	<p>A file hosting site utilizing an eclectic mix of C#, PHP and MySQL.</p>
<!--	<p>
	I was commissioned to develop a file hosting site, which needed to have a progress bar for uploading. The client requested that the site had to run on a windows 2003 server. If I wasn't on windows I'd have rebuilt the php engine with a patch I found to allow for a progress bar. Instead, I used an ASP.NET solution built in C# utilizing a LGPL'd .NET component called NeatUpload, which I integrated with the rest of the site that was in PHP &amp; MySQL. This was my first experience with AJAX, which was used in the site's gallery creation page.

	<p>A simple, dynamic directory of popular filehosts.</p>
<!--	<p>
	I was commissioned to create a simple directory of popular file hosts on the internet with a place to leave comments and allowed users to rate how well each host is. Initially the site was designed to be dynamic, allowing the administrator to add and remove hosts. But to alleviate the server load, a simple static html page is generated every night from the old dynamic site.

<!--	<p>
	I was commissioned to develop everything but the layout for a small website, www.boredclick.com. The site is a simple link posting site, where visitors post an interesting link, an administrator would then validate and approve the link, and then the link would be displayed on the front page for users to add comments.

<!--	<p>
	I was in charge of developing this website from the ground up. The website hosted people's images and allowed the creation of galleries. The site was entirely coded with PHP and MySQL. The website didn't last long, as the company could not handle the traffic the site was generating.
