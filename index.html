	    <span class="subHeader"><a href="http://www.commercetools.com/" title="commercetools" target="_blank">commercetools</a></span><span class="timeframeTotal">02/17 - present</span>
        <span class="timeframe centered">02/17 - 12/18 as <strong>Sr. Software Engineer</strong>, 12/18 - present as <strong>Engineering Manager</strong></span>
	<p>I currently lead a team of six engineers in what would be considered the Professional Services department of the US branch of commercetools.  Almost all of the implementation projects I've been a part of for this company have been on-time and on-budget.   I've grown my team from just myself to myself and six highly skilled, motivated, and happy engineers in just under a year.  I am currently enjoying all aspects of being an engineering manager - motivating my team, growing my team both in head count and skillsets.  I'm currently focused on becoming the best engineering manager I can.</p>
	<p>One of the things I'm proud of during my tenure was building out a proof of concept that helped land the company's second largest contract (estimated TCV: $5M). After the contract was won, I was heavily involved in the actual implementation project.  As of 8/2019, I am currently transitioning off of the project after an eight month engagement.  It involved working with many product owners from a fortune 50, along with their engineers, architects as well as engineers from commercetools and from a development agency.  This project is live and our code is being executed millions of times a day as a result. </p>
        <p>Before I put on the manager hat, as an engineer I was responsible for building out microservices to aid new and prospective clients on to the commercetools platform.  I was on a small team to build a feature for the commercetools platform.  The feature allows customers to be able to click, configure and deploy microservice-based integrations for their project easily.  The frontend for this was in React/Redux, the backend was in Javascript ES 6 via Node.  It utilized Kubernetes to manage the deployments.  </p>
	<p>I was also involved in the hiring process for new engineers - running technical interviews and administering and reviewing coding excerises.  This involvement in hiring, onboarding, and more lead me to obtaining the manager role I currently hold.</p>

        <span class="timeframe">06/15 - 12/16 as <strong>Sr. Web Developer</strong></span>
        <p>
	I was responsible for maintaining an existing codebase and developing new features.  During the first month of my employment I lead the development group to adopt Git and a feature branch workflow.  I also aided in server configuration and deployment processes, such as enabling distributed session storage and configuring a deployment script.  I was also involved with configuration of Jenkins, as well as the spinning of up new nodes on AWS EC2.  I also helped in hiring, and onboarding new developers.  I implemented a code review process using Crucible.  I then lead the port of Teamworks' back-end to a Python REST API using the pyramid framework.

        <p>
	At Metal Toad Media I developed code for various clients.  The projects I work on here were mostly Drupal sites.  Here's a small sampling of some of the Drupal sites I worked on: <a href="http://www.fearnet.com/">FEARnet</a>, <a href="http://www.infocus.com" >InFocus</a>, <a href="http://www.pvld.org/">PVLD</a>, <a href="http://www.greenbiz.com">Greenbiz</a>, <a href="http://www.hercampus.com/">HerCampus</a>, <a href="http://www.peci.org/">PECI</a>.  In addition to my Drupal work, I collaborated on a large HTML 5 JavaScript application, <a href="http://www.mgo.com">mGo</a>, targeted for mobile devices as well as television set top boxes and smart TVs.  I also had fun writing a small HTML 5 canvas game for Android devices via phonegap.  I was introduced to python and Django here and have worked on custom Django apps, including the backend to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/" title="Ken Burns America">Ken Burns America</a> and contributed code to <a href="http://notredam.org">NotreDAM</a>, and worked on the <a href="http://www.sony.com/">sony.com</a> backend.  I also aided in Puppet configuration and adding new puppet agents.
        </p>
      <p>
        I left when I was leading the support team.  This team is comprised of a project manager, a few developers and myself.  We provided extended development support for Metal Toad's various clients.  The variety in clients means that the support developers need to have a wide range of skills to help each client with their requests.  As the team lead I provide mentoring, technical direction to the developers on my team.  I also conduct one-on-one meetings with the developers to help identify stressors, set goals with the developers, and continuing to provide development support as needed.

        <p>
        As a developer at Ibex Data Systems, we focused on a few large clients' sites.  Each site had a similar, custom-built codebase that I helped to maintain and develop.  All work was done in PHP and I had fun learning the proper way to author jQuery plugins here.

	    <p>
	   The work at development now was specialized to mobilizing websites and building social media sites.  The social network engines I worked with were Dolphin, Social Engine, Buddypress, as well as custom-coded solutions.  All work was done in PHP and Ruby.  I also performed minor systems administration requests for a few clients.

	    <p>
	    I worked with a team of web developers to maintain and expand filefront.com.  I was involved with updating legacy code, implementing a memcached setup, implementing new features, developing many test cases for our infrastructure.  I also had to provide QA for other team members' code and then roll their changes out to the live site once it passed my requirements.  I was involved in maintaining the infrastructure as well (bringing up downed servers, restoring crashed databases, helping to roll out significant hardware upgrades, etc.).
	    </p>
      <p>
      As director of technology I oversaw a team of web developers and a system administrator.  I ensured the security and overall stability of the FileFront network.  I helped to upgrade many of the services running on our network to provide a higher level of security.  I managed about 200 servers running a variety of services (primarily on linux or freebsd) - http, ftp, mysql, video encoding, and more. I worked heavily with the systems administrator to set up new systems from installing the OS to service configuration.

	    <p>
	    I was the co-founder of AntiClothes, an online T-shirt store specializing in humor shirts.  I implemented the website in magento commerce, which was heavily modified to better suit our needs.  I handled all day to day operations: shipping, customer relation, inventory &amp; supply management, server management &amp; optimization, and site development.  I used a LAMP environment with memcached, svn, and apc.
