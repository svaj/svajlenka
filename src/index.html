          <article>
            <p>I was a backend engineer contributing new features to the commercetools platform.  My team's focus was the anayltics dashboard and the audit log features.</p>
            <p>
              While I was an engineering manager, I lead a team of six engineers in what would be considered the Professional Services department of the US branch of commercetools. Almost all of the implementation projects I've been a part
              of for this company have been on-time and on-budget. I grew my team from just myself to myself and six highly skilled, motivated, and happy engineers in just under a year. I am enjoy all aspects of being an engineering
              manager. From motivating my team, growing my team both in head count and skillsets to implementing or altering processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the things I'm proud of during my tenure was building out a proof of concept that helped land the company's second largest contract. Then I aided with the implementation of the production version of the application. It
              involved working with many product owners from a fortune 50, along with their engineers and architects in addition to as engineers from commercetools and a development agency. This project is live and our code is being executed
              millions of times a day as a result.  During my time at commercetools it was proven to scale to handle over 100,000 concurrent users.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I put on the manager hat, as an engineer I was responsible for building out microservices to aid new and prospective clients on to the commercetools platform. I was on a small team to build a feature for the
              commercetools platform. The feature allows customers to be able to click, configure and deploy microservice-based integrations for their project easily. The frontend for this was in React/Redux, the backend was in Javascript
              ES 6 via Node. It utilized Kubernetes to manage deployments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was also involved in the hiring process for new engineers - running technical interviews and administering and reviewing coding exercises. This involvement in hiring, onboarding, and more lead me to obtaining the manager
              role I held.

              I was responsible for maintaining an existing codebase and developing new features. During the first month of my employment I lead the development group to adopt Git and a feature branch workflow. I also aided in server
              configuration and deployment processes, such as enabling distributed session storage and configuring a deployment script. I was also involved with configuration of Jenkins, as well as the spinning of up new nodes on AWS EC2. I
              also helped in hiring, and onboarding new developers. I implemented a code review process using Crucible. I then lead the port of Teamworks' back-end to a Python REST API using the pyramid framework.

            <p>
              At Metal Toad Media I developed code for various clients. The projects I work on here were mostly Drupal sites. Here's a small sampling of some of the Drupal sites I worked on:
              <a href="http://www.fearnet.com/">FEARnet</a>, <a href="http://www.infocus.com">InFocus</a>, <a href="http://www.pvld.org/">PVLD</a>, <a href="http://www.greenbiz.com">Greenbiz</a>,
              <a href="http://www.hercampus.com/">HerCampus</a>, <a href="http://www.peci.org/">PECI</a>. In addition to my Drupal work, I collaborated on a large HTML 5 JavaScript application, <a href="http://www.mgo.com">mGo</a>, targeted
              for mobile devices as well as television set top boxes and smart TVs. I also had fun writing a small HTML 5 canvas game for Android devices via phonegap. I was introduced to python and Django here and have worked on custom
              Django apps, including the backend to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/" title="Ken Burns America">Ken Burns America</a> and contributed code to <a href="http://notredam.org">NotreDAM</a>, and worked on the
              <a href="http://www.sony.com/">sony.com</a> backend. I also aided in Puppet configuration and adding new puppet agents.
            </p>
            <p>
              I left when I was leading the support team. This team is comprised of a project manager, a few developers and myself. We provided extended development support for Metal Toad's various clients. The variety in clients means that
              the support developers need to have a wide range of skills to help each client with their requests. As the team lead I provide mentoring, technical direction to the developers on my team. I also conduct one-on-one meetings
              with the developers to help identify stressors, set goals with the developers, and continuing to provide development support as needed.

              I worked with a team of web developers to maintain and expand filefront.com. I was involved with updating legacy code, implementing a memcached setup, implementing new features, developing many test cases for our
              infrastructure. I also had to provide QA for other team members' code and then roll their changes out to the live site once it passed my requirements. I was involved in maintaining the infrastructure as well (bringing up
              downed servers, restoring crashed databases, helping to roll out significant hardware upgrades, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              As director of technology I oversaw a team of web developers and a system administrator. I ensured the security and overall stability of the FileFront network. I helped to upgrade many of the services running on our network to
              provide a higher level of security. I managed about 200 servers running a variety of services (primarily on linux or freebsd) - http, ftp, mysql, video encoding, and more. I worked heavily with the systems administrator to set
              up new systems from installing the OS to service configuration.
